## Using ArcGIS Assistant as an organization administrator

Some features of ArcGIS Assistant are only available if you are logged in as an organization administrator. If you're an organization administrator you are probably aware that you can manage content that belongs to others in your organization. ArcGIS Assistant respects these extra privileges and exposes a few special capabilities.

Keep reading this guide to learn about these features.

### Finding another user's items

Organization administrators can view the Content page of any member in the organization. You can read more about this in the [Manage items for a specific user](https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/manage-items.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_07BE763C011B4C0789FF6990B0FD177B) topic of the ArcGIS Online docs.

ArcGIS Assistant allows a similar capability â€“Â the item browser includes an additional "filter" at the top left of the page which allows you to choose any user in your organization. Choosing a user allows you to view their content instead of your own.

### Copying another user's content

#### Copying _from_ another user's account

Copying another user's items is as easy as [finding the item you want to copy](#finding-another-users-items) and beginning the [copy workflow](working-with-items#copying-items) from there.

#### Copying _to_ another user's account

The [copy workflow](working-with-items#copying-items) allows organization administrators to select any member in the organization as the copy destination.
