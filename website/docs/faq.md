## Which browsers are supported?

ArcGIS Assistant intends to support the following browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (Chromium only).

## Can I install ArcGIS Assistant on my own server?

Not yet, but we know this is important for many users and it is on our roadmap.

## Is ArcGIS Assistant supported by Esri?

No. ArcGIS Assistant is a community-driven project from Esri Professional Services. While all of the requests from Assistant use supported [ArcGIS REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/) operations, doing so could leave your content in a broken or reduced state, and Esri Technical Support will not be equipped to help you with that situation.

## What does ArcGIS Assistant use under the hood?

Assistant is built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/). It also makes heavy use of the amazing [arcgis-rest-js](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/) library to communicate with the [ArcGIS REST API](https://developers.arcgis.com/rest/).

## Where can I ask a question that isn't answered here?
