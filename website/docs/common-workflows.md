<!-- :::note Intent of this page

**ðŸ‘‰ This is a reference topic.** It's likely that this topic will come up on other pages, we should point them to this page to provide more details.

Many users of Assistant find it after reading about it on a blog, forum post, chat, conference talk, or similar. Users who find Assistant for the first time in this way may be excited about what it can do, but have nothing to go on beyond what they heard about it in passing.

ðŸ›‘ This page should describe some useful workflows that can only be achieved by Assistant (or are much easier to achieve with Assistant). We **should not** describe editing an item's tags or modifying the HTML in a Hub text card, for example (since those workflows are more appropriate via supported apps).
