Welcome to the ArcGIS Assistant guide!

Before we dive into any specifics, it's very important to note that Assistant is not a supported product and has some sharp edges that you can use to accidentally break things. Before getting too deep, please read the [warnings page](warnings).

If you'd like to jump straight in and start tinkering with ArcGIS Assistant, you can always get to the app by clicking the **Sign in to Assistant** link in the header.

If you're interested in the meta of ArcGIS Assistant, read on! If you'd like to hop straight into the user guides, feel free to skip to [Working with ArcGIS Accounts](working-with-accounts).

## A nod to AGO-Assistant

If you're familiar with [AGO-Assistant](https://ago-assistant.esri.com/), then you probably know that it has been a ridiculously helpful tool in the belt of ArcGIS power users [since 2013](https://github.com/Esri/ago-assistant/commit/dce17ad0638bf2277f35b963e75bfa99e7460ade). You also know that the ArcGIS system was a very different thing in 2013 compared to today. Over time, AGO-Assistant attracted a few contributors from time-to-time, but when its creator left Esri in 2015 it lost the driving force and started collecting dust. This, coupled with the ever-increasing speed with which the ArcGIS system began to grow, meant it became more and more difficult to update AGO-Assistant to work with an ecosystem very different from the one it was originally designed for.

## An essential tool for Esri PS

Over the years, AGO-Assistant became an essential tool for consultants and developers in [Esri Professional Services](https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/services/consulting). We use it to copy maps and apps, promote content from dev to test to prod, swap layer URLs, and much more. As ArcGIS progressed, AGO-Assistant wasn't keeping up and couldn't handle these workflows for newer ArcGIS apps like the new StoryMaps or Experience Builder. Members of Esri PS are entirely focused on building solutions and working with customers using the ArcGIS system, so the deterioration of AGO-Assistant was particularly challenging for us.

In 2020, a team of developers and consultants in Esri PS decided to experiment with a rebuild of AGO-Assistant, what we now call **ArcGIS Assistant**. The primary audience was our colleagues across Esri PS, but we know how useful this tool is for everyone, so we're really excited to share it.

## Introducing: ArcGIS Assistant

The new ArcGIS Assistant hopes to build upon the legacy of AGO-Assistant. While the new app is a complete rebuild, we have taken care to understand what made AGO-Assistant so great. We've poured through the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/Esri/ago-assistant/issues), interviewed users, and involved ArcGIS power users as testers throughout the project.

Mixing this history with a modern web app, user-centered design, and support for more components of the ArcGIS system, we're hoping ArcGIS Assistant is built on a solid foundation so that it can be as useful as AGO-Assistant for a long time to come.
